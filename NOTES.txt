# Create Transit Gateway Infrastructure
# 2 Regions
# 4 VPCs
    VPC A & B = us-east-1
    VPC C & D = us-east-2
# 2 Transit Gateways
# Do Transit Gateway Peering
# 1 subnet for each VPC 
# 1 Instance for each VPC 



# Transit Gateway
# Transit Gateway Attachment
# Transit Gateway Route tables



FIX:
ADD ROUTES TO ROUTE_TABLE TARGET TRANSIT GATEWAY 
    EXAMPLE:
        FOR VPC A, CREATE ROUTE TO VPC D, TARGET TRANSIT GATEWAY 1. 
ALSO:
    ASSOCIATE TRANSIT GATEWAY PEER CONNECTION TO TRANSIT GATEWAY TABLE.
    THEN CREATE STATIC ROUTE TO OTHER VPCS IN OTHER REGION.
